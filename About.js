      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>As a computer science student at Vellore Institute of Technology, I am passionate about programming and solving real-world problems with technology. I have a strong foundation in Python and C languages, and I have applied them to various projects and competitions, such as developing an app for campus navigation, creating a chatbot for mental health awareness, and participating in hackathons and coding contests. 

I am also involved in several extracurricular activities that enhance my skills and knowledge in different domains. I am a technical team member at Android Club and Microsoft Student Chapter, where I learn and share best practices in mobile and web development. I am a scientific researcher at SEDS, where I conduct experiments and analysis on topics related to space exploration and sustainability. I am an event management team member at Uddeshya and Malayalam Association, where I organise and execute various cultural and social events for the student community. Through these experiences, I have developed my interpersonal, leadership, and critical thinking skills, and I have collaborated with people from diverse backgrounds and disciplines. 

I am a motivated and hardworking individual who takes pride in being able to grasp new ideas and concepts quickly and effectively. I am always willing to learn and grow through my knowledge, and I seek challenging and rewarding opportunities as a computer science engineer. My goal is to contribute to the advancement and innovation of technology and society.
